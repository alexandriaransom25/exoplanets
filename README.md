Main Objective | I will be using machine learning to find exoplanets with NASA's data.  My goal is to create a machine learning model that can predict if an observation is a real candidate for an exoplanets or not. 

Data Background | The data was collected by the Kepler Mission... Kepler was able to find planets by observing dips in the brightness of stars when a planet transit is in front of it.
